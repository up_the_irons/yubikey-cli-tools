A collection of shell scripts for working with Yubico's YubiKey products on the
command line.

Requirements
------------

 * A YubiKey (http://www.yubico.com/yubikey)

Usage
-----

Scripts:

  * verify.sh

(That's it for now)

Run the scripts without arguments to see the options.

Example OTP verification (first 12 chars hidden)::

  $ ./verify.sh ____________njggegulrlldinifncbvcvunblbncdcr
  $ echo $?
  0
  $

A return value of zero means valid OTP.  Run without arguments to see all
possible return values.

Formatting
----------

This README is formatted in reStructredText [RST]_.  It has the best
correlation between what a document looks like as plain text vs. its
formatted output (HTML, LaTeX, etc...).  What I like best is, markup
doesn't look like markup, even though it is.
